## PO2 - MyVector Class 2
### Adesan Olamide
### Description:

This program creates a more robust MyVector class that includes some added functionality with the overloading of some C++ operators. 
The operations performed by using a particular operator will be defined by us with a brief discussion on what we should do.
We do not have to abide by convention, we can define each operator to do anything we want.
